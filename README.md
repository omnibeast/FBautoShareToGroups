# FBautoShareToGroups
A Python script that shares every new post from a specific Facebook page to all the groups that the user has joined, with a specified interval between each post. The script uses the Facebook Graph API and the facebook library to interact with Facebook, and implements error handling to catch any exceptions that might occur during execution.

The facebook library installed (you can install it using pip install facebook-sdk)
Usage

  Replace <INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN> with your Facebook Access Token.
  Replace /PAGE_ID with the ID of the specific page you want to share posts from.
  Run the script using Python (e.g. python share_posts.py).
